                    <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                    <p>
                      I study Applied Mathematics and Engineering at Queen's University, nicknamed <b>"Apple Math"</b>, in the Computing and Communications stream. 
                      It is quite a unique program where half of my courses are taken with computer engineers (algorithms, data structures, OOP, software development, etc.), and the other half are taken with math majors (real/complex analysis, probability, stochastics, infomration theory, etc.). Apple Math graduates enter the workforce with <b>as much technical expertise as computer engineers</b>, and having taken <b>more math courses than math majors</b>.
                      <br><br>
                      This program fits me perfectly since I love math and solving problems, and I find that going through logical proofs helps my critical thinking skills that I can apply to other parts of my life. As well, with my computer courses, I get the techincal groundwork that I use in the workplace and build off of in my personal projects. 
                      <br><br>
                      I am enrolled in the Queen's University co-op program, and am currently recruiting for <b>Summer 2025 internships </b>before I finish my final year at school,
                      <br><br>
                      I love to learn new things, and I take extreme pride in my learning. I have received many awards based on academic acheivement, but here are a few I am particularly proud of.
                     
                      <ul>

                    <p>
                        I find satisfaction in making things work. Driven by curiousity and a passion to learn new things, and I am always looking for new challenges
                        to keep life interesting.
                        <br><br>
                        Ever since I was young, I always spent hours on end tinkering with puzzles, games, and anything that made me think. Today, that same curiousity
                        inspires me to continually learn and grow while contributing to society in the best way I know how.

                  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                  <p>
                    I love to spend time <b>outdoors</b> (canoeing, hiking, snowshoeing... you name it!). I have led many canoe trips, and paddled the Moisie river - a trip that took 26 days! I also love to ski and am a certified ski instructor, as well as an experienced tennis instructor. 
                    <br><br>
                    Playing <b>volleyball</b> is one of my biggest passions (indoors and beach). I played competetitvely in high school, playing on both my school team and my club team. I was co-captain of my club team, on which we consistently placed in the top 8 teams in Canada. I continue to play regularly at university, playing 3+ times a week in intramurals and local Kingston leagues.
                    <br><br>
                    I also love to volunteer and am quite involved with the <b>Queen's Engineering Society</b>. Across various roles, I had responsibilities such as overseeing and supporting Queen's 20 design teams, organizing and leading the logistics of Queen's Engineering's famous Orientation Week, and representing the Apple Math student body to the faculty. 
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, I love to solve <b>puzzles</b>. I do the daily NYT Crossword (as well as the Mini!) and love any and all puzzles. That's why I like coding so much, every task is a puzzle, and the challenge is to find the most efficient solution possible!

                        Key tasks to do this included i) proving time invariance of the system ii) estimating noise and filtering it out (used Fourier Analysis to justify low-pass filter) iii)
                        creating a Bode plot based on an efficient algorithm to test different frequencies iv) estimating a corresponding trasnfer function and implementing feed-forward compensation
                        to ensure the system was minimum phase v) designing and testing a PID controller
                        <br><br>
                        The controller exceeded all target specifications and was deemed top of the class.">

                                My role at Celestica consisted on working on the interal data analytics team of the Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS) division. 
                                Since some of my team was less technical, I was able to take a leadership role on the data engineering aspect of the team, working to increase efficiency.
                                In one of my major projects, I restructured our production database to reduce refresh times by over 70%. I was also able to generate key data points that weren't used by the team thorugh writing Google App Scripts (Javascript).

                                Additionally, I was in constant communication with the Celestica leadership team and global ATS sites to develop and maintain over 120 PowerBI dashboards
                                to drive financial and business decisions.

                                I was awarded an NSERC USRA grant to support my control theory research with professor Kexue Zhang.
                                My research primarily focused on developing sufficient conditions for input-to-state stability of non-linear systems
                                on time scales in terms of two measures.
                                <br><br>
                                In layman's terms, I worked to find develop and prove mathematical conditions that allowed us to determine if a complicated 
                                system of differential equations was "input-to-state stable" without actually needing to solve the equation itself, which is often impossible.
                                Beyond the technical proofs, I also extensively used MATLAB to simulate these systems and test our findings.

                                I worked as a teaching assistant for APSC 174, an introductory course to linear algebra for first-year engineers. I taught weekly tutorials
                                and answered questions by email.
                                <br><br>
                                The course covered basic linear algebra such as vector spaces, set theory, linear transformations, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
